<h1 align="center">Samvaad - A LIVE Gmeet Translator Bot</h1>

<p>The biggest insipiration came from Black Wings itself, where our team consisted of 2 Hindi and 2 native-English speakers. 
We realized how it would be extremely handy to have a bot that behaves likes a human translator. 

Communication is an essential practice in almost every aspect of human life. Miscommunication can be hazardous, and it can happen to anyone, specially when they do not speak the same language.

<em>Our Very own solution to this dilemma was Samvaad Bot:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>A Gmeet Optimiser : A Google meet bot that joins the meeting by invitation.</li>
<li>
A Bilingual Translator : You don't need a bilingual translator to convey messages to each side; use this bot for all your online meetings.</li>
<li>

It's Free : No need to pay heavy translation charges. Samvaad is entirely free to use</li>

</ol>
